# compiler

A modular compiler frontend project developed for coursework and experimentation,
featuring a configurable lexer and parser framework. This project supports multiple
parsing strategies including recursive descent and various LR-based algorithms.

---

## ✨ Features

- Modular lexer and parser architecture
- Support for:
  - Recursive Descent Parser
  - LR(0), SLR(1), and LR(1) Parsers
- Abstract Syntax Tree and Syntax Tree generation
- Configurable build via `Kconfig` (inspired by Linux kernel)
- Platform-independent `Makefile` build system

---

## ⚙️ Configuration (Kconfig System)

Before building, run:

    make menuconfig

This will bring up a text-based configuration interface similar to the Linux kernel. You can select:

    Whether to enable debug output

    Which parser algorithm to use:

        Recursive Descent

        LR (with subtypes LR(0), SLR(1), LR(1))

    Whether to output the syntax tree

    Whether to print leftmost derivation

Once configured, header file include/generated/autoconf.h will be created.
🛠️ Building

To build the entire project:

    make

To clean all generated files:

    make clean

🖥️ Platform Compatibility

The Makefile detects your operating system and automatically adapts:

    On Linux/macOS: uses mkdir -p and rm -rf

    On Windows: uses if not exist and del /Q

🧪 Testing

Unit tests are implemented in src/unittest/. Build artifacts and object files are placed under build/.
📜 Origin of Configuration System

This project uses a lightweight Kconfig system ported from the open-source project 一生一芯 (Yisheng Yixin), which itself derives from the GNU/Linux kernel configuration infrastructure. It is a robust and scalable solution suitable for embedded toolchains, compiler frameworks, and large-scale configurable C projects.
